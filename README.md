# Project1---Human-Face-Eye-Detection
This is my first project which I made in my first academic year in Post Graduation.

Face detection is one of the most challenging problems in disciplines such as image processing,pattern recognition and computer vision. With the improvements in information technology, face detection / recognition has wide usage in applications such as personal identity, video surveillance, witness face reconstruction, computerized aging, control systems (like tracing fatigue of drivers to avoid traffic accidents), HCI (human computer interaction, which provides control of computer based system, with no need of interaction through usage of mouse, keyboard etc.), video game controllers.There are many methods for face detection, but here we will complete this project using Haar Feature method.
Face Detection is the first and essential step for face recognition, and it is used to detect faces in the images. It is a part of object detection and can use in many areas such as security, bio-metrics, law enforcement, entertainment, personal safety, etc.
Face detection using Haar cascades is a machine learning based approach where a cascade function is trained with a set of input data. OpenCV is a library of Python bindings designed to solve computer vision problems. OpenCV already contains many pre-trained classifiers for face, eyes, smiles, etc.
